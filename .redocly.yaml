# Redocly Configuration for SecPal API

# Rules customization:
# - operation-4xx-response: Disabled for health/monitoring endpoints.
#
#   Health check endpoints (like /health) semantically only return:
#   - 200 OK (service is healthy)
#   - 503 Service Unavailable (service is unhealthy)
#
#   Client errors (4xx) are not applicable because these endpoints:
#   - Accept no parameters
#   - Perform no user-driven operations
#   - Have no authentication or authorization requirements
#
#   Future API endpoints that accept user input MUST include appropriate
#   4xx error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, etc.) in their OpenAPI specs.
